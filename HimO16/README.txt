A Note on the Cross Gramian for Non-Symmetric Systems (Companion Code)
======================================================================

## Compatibility: 

compatible to Matlab(>=2015a) and Octave(>=4.0.0)

## Usage:

`nonsym(0)` % compute difference between average system's cross Gramian and non-symmetric cross Gramian

`nonsym(1)` % compute and plot results for reduction of state-space symmetric MIMO system

`nonsym(2)` % compute and plot results for reduction of SIMO system

`nonsym(3)` % compute and plot results for reduction of square, non-symmetric MIMO system

`nonsym(4)` % compute and plot results for reduction of ISS-1r benchmark system

`nonsym(5)` % compute and plot results for reduction of FOM benchmark system

## Framework:

uses the **emgr** framework for computing empirical gramians
from [http://gramian.de](http://gramian.de).
